    <h3>Home Page: Introduction to Robotics and Its Applications</h3>

    <p>When people hear of robots, they may think of many things. A robot is defined as a machine capable of carrying
        out a complex series of actions automatically, especially one programmable by a computer. In a more basic way of
        explaining it, a robot is a human that can do things that most humans are not capable of doing or equivalent.
        Robotics is another thing that has to do with robots. The dictionary definition states, “Robotics the branch of
        technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots.” This area has
        created a large impact on how they develop today and how technology has advanced so much. Speaking of
        advancements in technology, Robotics has led to a new thing that has made life easier for others.</p>

    <p>This video has shown us how technology has evolved so much in the past years. For example, there may not be
        enough police officers in an area. Robots are now able to help patrol and keep the city safe. The new technology
        has created a safer place for the areas it 's needed in. I find this very interesting because when I was younger
        I watched a movie called “Robots” It was released in 2005. The movie has robots living in cities and doing the
        things us humans do every day. Back then I didn 't think robot police, animals, military etc. would be around,
        now in 2016 the technology in that movie is</p>

    <h3>Robots in Industry: Key Advancements in Industrial Automation</h3>

    <p>Cartesian robots, also known as gantry robots, are designed with a rectangular coordinate system, just like the
        XYZ axes on a graph. Featuring simple, linear mechanics, complete with three sliding joints, cartesian robots
        move in straight lines, making for ideal application in fields like manufacturing and automation, where they can
        position and move objects with high accuracy and repeatability.Cylindrical robots have a single extendable arm
        that rotates and undulates on a fixed, circular base. This base, which operates on an x-axis, is a cylindrical
        post that supports the single-rotary, double-linear jointed configuration and is responsible for the namesake of
        these machines. Known for their compact design, cylindrical robots work in tight spaces and can access objects
        from various angles within a specific radius. Typically, cylindrical robots can carry heavy payloads and are
        especially equipped for welding, packaging and machine tending </p>

    <p>Delta robots are turbo-speed machines typically built with three individually controlled arms that connect to a
        common triangular base. Thanks to their unique configuration, where its motors connect to the body instead of
        the arms, delta robots are renowned for their exceptional speed and agility. These arachnid-like bots specialize
        in rapid and repetitive actions, like pick-and-place operations in manufacturing and packaging.Selective
        Compliance Assembly Robot Arm (SCARA) robots combine three-axis mobility with rotational motion. These machines
        feature two parallel rotary joints for horizontal movement and a linear joint for vertical motion. SCARA robots
        are some of the fastest machines to deliver pick-and-place operations fit for building electronics and
        large-scale food manufacturing.</p>

    <h3>Humanoid Robots: Overview of Humanoid Robots and Theri Capabilitys</h3>

    <p>Our world's tools and infrastructure have been molded around human usage. By mimicking our form, humanoid robots
        can operate within existing environments without major overhauls. But their human-inspired design goes beyond
        just practical integration – the human body itself is an engineering marvel. Our physiques grant incredible
        flexibility, facilitating diverse mobility and adaptability across environments. Current imitation learning
        techniques allow humanoid robots to replicate our fluid movements and manipulation skills, rapidly mastering
        complex physical tasks. The focus of embodied AI is capabilities like perception, cognition, learning,
        decision-making, and interaction with the environment. Humanoid robots refer to intelligent robots with
        human-like external features and motion abilities. They can walk on two legs, coordinate arms and body to
        function, and communicate with humans.</p>

    <p>Intelligent humanoid robots are engineered to emulate the human "perception-cognition-decision-execution" cycle.
        They contain mechanical body structures and actuated limbs akin to our musculoskeletal system. Sensor suites
        mimic our senses like vision, touch, and proprioception. Control architectures evoke the brain, cerebellum, and
        brain stem, governing cognition, decision-making, and motor control. Some even have interaction modules for
        communication akin to our social intelligence.Humanoid robots rely on their perception systems – sensor arrays
        analogous to our senses – to gather information about their external environment and internal states. Common
        sensors include vision, touch/force, displacement & orientation sensors. Among these, vision sensors are
        paramount, as sight enables core reasoning about the world.</p>
